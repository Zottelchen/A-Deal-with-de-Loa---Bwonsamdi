# A Deal with de Loa - Bwonsamdi

Bwonsamdi is your friend - he made a deal with you. He will always bring you back... for a price - and a good laugh.

 
**So what does this addon do?**

It plays Bwonsamdi voicelines when you die (and prints them in chat). Make sure you've got the Dialog-sound on, otherwise you wont be able to hear him!

* 18 random voicelines (some standard messages when you die + some which weren't purposed for that ... but probably still work)
* 2 special voicelines, which only play if you finished the Nazmir achievement step "A Pact with Death" (Horde only)
* all class voicelines
* 5 easter egg voicelines by 3 special guests (which *rarely* play)
